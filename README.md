This module allows you to parse and use different waveforms that describe the gravitational waves produced by post-merger neutron stars. 

To use, you can clone the git repo. To use the package anywhere on your computer, follow the following two steps:

1. in your .bash_profile/.bashrc/.zshrc (omit as necessary) you will need to add an environment variable NRWAVEFORM_DIR that points to wherever you keep your numerical relativity waveforms you've downloaded from the CoRE database
2. Add the module directory to your python path
3. make sure you source your *rc file

I am in the process of adding more analytic waveforms. Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements or if you want me to add your favourite
